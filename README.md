# Exercise Portfolio Template

## Template

This repository has been created to simplify the process of adding your visualizations to the web.

You are welcome to modify these and/or create your own design. Keep in mind you want to keep the code of your design relatively simple so it does not interfere with your visualizations.

### Assets

The following files/directories are included in this repository:

- README.md (this file)
- css
  - style.css
- data
  - .keep (allows the directory to be recognized by git)
- js
  - d3.min.js
- index.html
- template.html

### Instructions


**NOTE: These instructions are no longer applicable since the repository has been moved to the archive. If you choose to use these files, you will need to set this up using your own knowledge of GitHub and GitHub Pages.**

#### Setup

1. If you have not already, sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. Be sure to verify your email.

2. In this repo (`umiami-data-viz/exercise-portfolio`), click **Fork**. This will make a copy of the repo in *your* account. When the process is complete, you will be looking at the copied version.

3. Click the **Settings** option and scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. Under **Source**, change the pulldown from None to **master branch**. The page will refresh.

4. Scroll down, again to the **GitHub Pages**. You should see the following message (where username is *your* username):

```text
Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/exercise-portfolio/.
```

5. Click the link. This will take you to your portfolio on the web.


#### Update

6. Using either [GitHub Desktop]() or the command line, clone the `exercise-portfolio` repository in in your account.

7. On your computer, edit the `index.html` file where comments are made. Add your name to the `h1`. You may also want to write a short introduction as to what the site is about.

  As you add new exercises, add a link to each file and change the link text to reflect the type of chart (i.e. Bar Chart, Scatterplot).

8. Also update `template.html` to include your name in the `h1`. Note the content of this file. Once you have added your name, this is ready for you to make duplicate copies, rename it based on the exercise (i.e. `bar-chart.html`) and just begin coding your visualization.

  For every visualization you create, you will want to add a title for the visualization in the `h2` and add a short description of the visualization in the paragraph below.

  Always provide a title for the visualization and text explaining what it is about. Do not assume your reader will see the chart, labels and automatically understand.

  You may also want to indicate in a separate paragraph what the purpose of the exercise was (i.e. "This visualization demonstrates building a bar chart with d3").

9. When you have completed the updates, commit these changes in GitHub Desktop (or via the command line) and push the files to GitHub.

10. Check the URL GitHub provided (`https://username.github.io/exercise-portfolio/`) to see the updated files have been published.
